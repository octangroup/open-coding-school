                    like InVision, Figma and Thunkable. Thereafter you will be introduced to programming mobile
                    applications for Android phones with Java. You will cover frameworks and best practices for creating
                    the user interface and learn how to create the backend-logic and the database-structure that
                    supports your app.
                    Participants of this course should have some prior knowledge of HTML and CSS and be very familiar

                        Introduction to Python programming
                    </template>
                    Python is the worldâ€™s fastest growing programming language. It has multiple applications in web
                    development, data analytics and many other fields. It is easy to get started with and at the same
                    time the language is versatile enough to get you up to very advanced projects. Learning Python is a
                    great way to enter the world of algorithms and the logical thinking that lies behind any piece of
                    software. While some prior knowledge, e.g. from a web development course, is useful, it is not
                    strictly necessary. You do, however, need to be ready to put in a lot of extra effort outside of
                    class to manage to crack the world of algorithms.

                        architecture. You will reflect on the driving factors of performance reliability, scalability
                        and security and how to optimize the architecture of your software for those factors. You will
                        also learn different state-of-the-art approaches to defining requirements of your software and
                        implementing them in your architecture decisions. This course will use the Laravel framework.
                        Our course projects will be advanced web applications but you are welcome to bring questions to
                        class from any type of PHP project you are currently working on.
                        To ensure a homogenous level of the class we require all participants to have advanced skills in
                        PHP and be familiar with the Laravel framework. Participants will need to show previous projects
                        they have worked on during the application process, to verify their skill-level.

                        This will, however, be supplemented by additional technology and tooling recommendations
                        (focussing on AWS and the Google Cloud Platform) and small exercise-projects to familiarize

                        We challenge you to work on concrete projects from day 1 - even in our introductory courses.
                        This helps you to always fully understand the practical relevance and application of every
                        single thing you learn. It also ensures that you leave our classes with fully job-ready skills
                        that allow you to be productive immediately.

                        At the same time our online-materials will allow you to revise, continue learning and work on
                        your projects outside of class, at your own pace.</p>
